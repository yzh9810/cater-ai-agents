Given a user input, your goal is to select the closest matching from following options. 
            
    Options:
            {options}


    The user input is the following:
    
    Input: 
            {input}


Given the context, it's preferable to make a selection whenever feasible, aiming to closely match the user's input. 
However, if it's apparent that the desired option is not available in the provided options, you should opt for indicating that no suitable option is found.

    1. If an option closely matches the input and seems like what the user is looking for, select that option. 
        Respond in json format:
        {{
            "status": "selected", 
            "option": {{
                    "id": option_id,
                    "name": option_name,
                    "description": option_description,
                    "selected_modifications":  [   
                        {{
                            "modification_id": modification_id,
                            "name": modification_name,
                            "description": modification_description,
                            "modification_option_id": modification's_option_id,
                        }}, ....
                    ],
                }}, ....
        }} 

    2. If multiple options are related to input and it's unclear which one would best match the input without additional details, indicate the need for more information. 
        Respond in json format:
        {{
            "status": "need_details",
            "options": [
                {{
                    "id": option_id,
                    "name": option_name,
                    "description": option_description,
                    "selected_modifications":  [
                        {{
                            "modification_id": modification_id,
                            "name": modification_name,
                            "description": modification_description,
                            "modification_option_id": modification's_option_id,
                        }}, ....
                    ],
                }}, ....
            ]
        }}

    3. If upon reviewing the list, it is evident that the specified input has no relevance to any of the options, then acknowledge the absence of an appropriate match.
        Respond in json format:
        {{
            "status": "not_found"
        }}
